## How to commit

This project is going to use [conventionalcommits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) as commit format to help us create changelogs

#### Example

```
git commit -m "chore: update dependencies"
```

#### If you don't know the coventionalcommits syntax:

Install commitizen as global utility

```
yarn global add commitizen cz-conventional-changelog
```

Create a `.czrc` file in your home directory, with `path` referring to cz-conventional-changelog

```
echo '{ "path": "cz-conventional-changelog" }' > ~/.czrc
```

On windows copy the following line to the PowerShell:

```
write-output '{ "path": "cz-conventional-changelog" }'  | out-file $env:HOME/.czrc
```
